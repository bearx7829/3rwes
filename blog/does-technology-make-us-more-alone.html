Researchers have found that it makes people feel less worried and less free.</p><p>At the same time, technology relies more on social contacts, which is relatively dependent on real -life contacts. Talking technology can enjoy face -to -face conversations, feel more upset, and damage mental fitness. Loneliness can be even more painful, where exhibition of ideal images of friends can be negatively compared. Technology can feel&nbsp;more lonely&nbsp;because people can rely more on social media contacts than real -life contacts.</p><p>Research about&nbsp;technology :</p><p>Recent studies have shown that despite being more connected, more people feel&nbsp;more lonely&nbsp;than ever. Another recent study showed that 48 % of respondents had only one confession compared to a similar study 25 years ago when people said they had three people they could trust.&nbsp;Exhibit negative traits such as narcissism in real life.&nbsp;When users post permanently about their lives and presence and try to up or copy&nbsp;Instagram's&nbsp;influence life, it creates selfishness and lack of sympathy for others - The average amount of screen time spent in today's days has increased by 11 hours. This is an increase of nine hours and 45 minutes from last year's research.</p><p>Technology provides the possibility of working far away, so that the news and its latest developments are able to maintain, and it gives the ability to call with family and friends, and even importantly&nbsp;It&nbsp;is connected to each other. Although technology has created the illusion that everyone is extremely attached, and when people in fact lose real human interaction, which reduces the epidemic of loneliness and the team's commitment. The freedom given by the technology has had an opposite impact on personal needs. Instead of feeling connected to people, they ignite feelings of loneliness and loneliness.</p><p>Technology Connects us on Social&nbsp;media :</p><p>Technology can make people feel more relying on social contacts,&nbsp;then&nbsp;depends on real -life contacts. It is easy to make friends with real life. This shows how much people can be associated with technology. Focusing on the screen makes people forget the difference between being lonely and lonely. Technology negatively affects our social interaction, making it socially strange and lonely.</p><p>Technology has made the world more "connected". The Internet, in which we use all these Nifty gadgets, has increased us more access to information, interaction through social media, and we pay our bills, buy our own and buy our bills. Even the game has been made. People on the other side of the world - they are all comfortable in our own homes. What is the time to survive, some&nbsp;people can say. However, other people argue that far from bringing us closer, technology is in fact leaving us more isolated and lonely.</p><p>According To&nbsp;Survey :</p><p>Whether technology can be directly accused or not, the fact cannot be denied that the world is currently in the bell that is being described as&nbsp;a&nbsp;"epidemic of isolation". A 2018 survey of the Economist and Caesar Family Foundation (KFF) shows that more than fifth (22 %) of American adults say they always feel lonely, lack of companionship. They are, or left or feel isolated. A similar story is going on across the pond, 23 % of adults in the UK are responding similarly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These results come to the back of a separate Sugar study, which shows that almost half of Americans always feel lonely (46 %) or leave (47 %). Last year, the British BBC Radio 4 released the results of its "loneliness experience", which found that one -third of the British often feel lonely. Throughout the European Union, about 30 million adults often feel lonely, while in Japan, an estimated half million people close themselves from society, often living in their homes for months.</p><p>Loneliness :</p><p>Loneliness is changing life-even life-threatening-those who experience it. Psychological problems such as alcohol and drug use, eating disorders and depression, the devastating effects of loneliness cannot be promoted. There is also a lot of evidence to suggest that isolation produces psychological as well as psychological problems, and can even lead to death. According to data published in The Independent, an analysis of 300,000 people in 148 studies has shown that loneliness is linked to a 50 % increase in death for any reason. In other words, it does not matter that a person may suffer from&nbsp;illness,&nbsp;loneliness makes him worse and makes it difficult to recover from the condition. In these terms, the analysis was concluded, loneliness can be considered than 15 cigarettes a day, and obesity is more dangerous.</p><p>Study's authors say people need to deal with the negative effects of loneliness, people need real, personally. However, the more we rely on the more technology-home and workplace-to-work-work, completing daily tasks and performing work duties, as little time with our friends, family and fellow workers. Singing face to face, leading us back to the question.</p><p>Although different studies show a slightly different statistics, the overall trend is clear - we are really addicted to technology&nbsp;technology, and especially the use of social media has scored in recent years. A report from the Global Web Index last year estimates that digital users are now spending an average of 22 hours 22 minutes on social networks and messaging services. Young-16-24 children spend more time-which increases about 3 hours a day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The use of technology has far -reaching effects on people's daily life. It can be argued that modern technology makes the world more integrated. People enjoy increasing interaction through social networking, increasing information, and without technology it is almost impossible to do something. However, instead of bringing people closer, it seems that the dependence on technology is rapidly causing people to disconnect with public interaction, so more loneliness. Technology is causing people to change their way of understanding themselves and their relationships.</p><p>You think&nbsp;its&nbsp;close you but in real&nbsp;not :</p><p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; text-align: start; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: 21.6px;"><br></p><p>It is interesting that the thing that brings people closer may be cut off from real life conversation. Most of the technology -based communications are mostly unusual. It seems that the new social media has an interesting ability to promote social connection, but the most important social information of the sender and the recipient is left when diagnosing digital (Lopkini, 2013). Smartphones and other mobile gadgets are particularly accused of withdrawing people from social life. Since smartphones have integrated many features such as internet connectivity and multimedia capabilities, many people check their phones several times a day and spend many hours using gadgets. It is not surprising to be surrounded by people in a room who are engaged in their phone rather than real conversation (Lopesini, 2013). The situation is probably worse for people who do not enjoy communication in front of them because technology keeps them away from the real world.</p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
