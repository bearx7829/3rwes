            <div class="u-align-justify u-blog-control u-post-content u-text u-text-2 fr-view"><p>Create a list :</p><p>You might have thought "2022 is going to be my year," but why will this be your year? From now on, record everything from 2023. Is your friend's wedding, a special birthday, a big life change, graduation, or birthday fun event? About the little things, like your favorite TV show's new season or&nbsp;list of your books like you want&nbsp;to get? What will&nbsp;happen&nbsp;even the little things like changing seasons or recipes you are excited to cook? There is no need to wait until 2022 2022 is "your year".</p><p>Record of lessons from Past&nbsp;years :</p><p>Whether in your career, relationships, life conditions, or happiness and fitness, you may see a big difference from where you were last year. And when you see where you are now compared to where you were the last decade, change is even more memorable. You have changed and increased into years (languages), so identify what is different. Which lesson have you learned, and how have you grown up that you are proud of? Instead of focusing on what the next work, celebrate how far you have come, knowing that you are doing better than your thinking.</p><p>Vacations :</p><p>The New Year should not be about change. It should also be about the celebration. Whenever you can take some PTO, treat yourself a passage, whether it's a Europe trip you have always dreamed about, a long weekend in the nearest town with your best friends,&nbsp;Or&nbsp;stay in the summer with your most important second or sister. Looking forward to this year, not only will be a journey, but it will also be a way to remember 2022 in the coming years, celebrating what you have achieved in 2021.</p><p>Spend&nbsp;Time :</p><p>Instead of committing new things to do, make a pledge with loved ones that already exist in your life. Call your mother more frequently, schedule weekly coffee dates with your wife's wife, plan more&nbsp;bronchings&nbsp;with your best friend, for a new yoga studio with your sister Sign up, and fit with my important other on weekly history. However, it may not be about getting "happiness" that we do not yet have, but what we already have is that we need more. Trust&nbsp;me,&nbsp;it will be a resolution that will remain.</p><p>Make a&nbsp;vision :</p><p>Resolutions are often focused on "to do", or the process you need to take. Instead, pay attention to the person you want to be and the life you want. Create a vision board that you want, whether in your career, your love life (Tom Holland photos, anybody?),&nbsp;Your&nbsp;home environment, or how you see your true self. It is not necessary to expand or build it. Your vision board can be just as easy as a larger photo round list is tapped on the refrigerator. Set the Vision Board in a place you will often see and increase your dreams as well. Focus on "existence", and "to do" will be natural.</p><p>List Of why You Love Your&nbsp;Self :</p><p>Changing screw - you're already very good as you are. Make a list of everything about yourself as you are writing a letter of love: the smiles you meet with your mother, strong legs that can run from miles, even laughing when you are sad, or worked hard Ethics that you will be proud of your small self. Also, record what is getting better in your&nbsp;life.&nbsp;Are you close to your siblings, living in the city you love, or the career you always want? Important is important for the purpose of development, but if we cannot feel happy after we reach them, what is the benefit of creating goals?</p><p>Different&nbsp;themes :</p><p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: 21.6px;"><br></p><p>Instead of resolutions for a whole year, devote each month to a theme. For example, January focus can add more plants to your diet, February's attention is looking for your choice of workout, focusing on your financing to save the maximum amount of money It can be about to do, and April intends to spend more time in nature. Feel more than 36 365 days to reach a certain purpose (and more entertainment (and more entertainment!). The key is that you are determining intentions rather than eliminating goals, which means that you are still doing great transition and development in different walks of life, regardless of what you do. You will be proud.</p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
