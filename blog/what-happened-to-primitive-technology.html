It quickly became the Internet sensation, which collected more than 10 million users and reached fans around the world.</p><p>But then, of course, this super popular channel disappeared from our screens. So what happened to this world's famous YouTuber, and what could it take to stop this channel suddenly?</p><p><span class="u-text-palette-1-base">These days, we all know the impressive stories of&nbsp;YouTuberswho made millions of people go viral and get fans around the world thanks to their video content.</span></p><p><span class="u-text-palette-1-base">We have all heard stories of the success of these influence, but a particular channel has a particularly unique story.</span></p><p>Startup :</p><p>It will be "ancient technology", which has not been found to fans around the world because of its charming offer or fashion indicators, but in fact because of its naked simplicity and silent reflection.</p><p>The channel started from an unknown man, just uploading videos of self -construction to build things using natural materials.</p><p>Videos uploaded to ancient technology today you see on YouTube that most of the videos were not like. He was not a sharp or funny celebrity update or makeup and fashion lessons.</p><p>The channel write on its website, "primitive technology is anhobby to make anything in jungle using tools for beginners ."&nbsp;</p><p>"This is a stringent principle. If you want to use a fire,&nbsp;a&nbsp;ax - pick up a stone and make it, a hut from a hut, trees,&nbsp;mud, stones, etc. The task&nbsp;is for how&nbsp;far you can go without technology&nbsp;and expert guide. â€œ</p><p>Starting&nbsp;Famous :</p><p>Since ancient technology began to get more and more followers, fans around the world were increasingly surprised by informative and interesting videos.</p><p>A special video that blows the minds of the audience everywhere was when the mysterious man merely developed a palm of palm leaves and mud and charcoal.</p><p>Using only these natural materials, he managed to make a maker and some charcoal - which means his natural&nbsp;technology&nbsp;had a new and high temperature.</p><p>After posting some videos and getting more and more followers, the mysterious man behind ancient technology was becoming incredibly popular.</p><p>But he didn't even realize how much he was really blowing.</p><p>Because by that time, the YouTube channel had only become more than a light interesting page. It was completely viral!</p><p>No one could believe it, but so far the ancient technology channel had collected and counted more than a million consumers.</p><p>Despite the beautiful heights of channel reputation and popularity, the mysterious man behind the videos was cautious not to let himself turn into a hero or symbol.</p><p>In fact, he went beyond the&nbsp;curtain,&nbsp;he was nothing but a regular man.</p><p>Simple&nbsp;man :</p><p>He wrote, "It should be clear that I do not live in the wild but follow it only as a hobby." "I live in a modern house and eat modern food."</p><p>When fame for this popular YouTuber increased, many people began to wonder about the truth of the man behind the scenes.</p><p>The mysterious&nbsp;creator was incredibly honest and open&nbsp;about his creative process.</p><p>He wrote, "I just want to see how people worked and made things in ancient times." "It's a good hobby that keeps you fit and does not raise anything other than time and effort."</p><p>The world was loved by this interesting and pious person who starred in its exciting YouTube videos. Since people saw more and more amazing clips, they have learned about some extremely complex and extraordinary creations from the beginning.</p><p>But when they learned a lesson from this person, there was one thing that everyone was completely unaware of his name.</p><p>Despite his interesting points and videos, and despite being opened about his creation, the man still refused to reveal his identity.</p><p>Since the mysterious man's true identity behind "ancient technology" and why he kept hiding it, the man focused on ignoring and merely focusing on him.&nbsp;How to hide and focus on it began to grow.&nbsp;Creation from the beginning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Natural&nbsp;creation :</p><p>His next project was making iron pills, small iron balls, which would provide a lot of support to his natural creations.</p><p>He wrote, "I smelled iron bacteria and&nbsp;prepared a little&nbsp;amount of iron." "In my ongoing struggle to reach Iron's era, more experiments about furnace design and ore treatment were done."</p><p>Since the world was attracted to the mysterious man behind ancient technology and its amazing videos, the man also preferred to keep his original identity a secret.</p><p>But nevertheless, he was happy to answer other types of questions.</p><p>Fans will have to contact to ask things like, "Which dangerous animals are there?" For which he replied happily, "Only the poisonous snake and I need to see where I step. Crocodiles do not live where I build these huts and there are no ground hunters in the bush (which I am aware of).</p><p>Since speculations are growing around the real identity of the man behind ancient technology, he knew that the only way to remove the public from this question was to make this video so&nbsp;interesting,&nbsp;focusing on It will be attracted to it.</p><p>And likewise, he decided to work on his very expensive project so far - from the beginning he created a whole hut.</p><p>He had once tried to make a hut once, but due to the loss of heavy rains, he fell and declined.</p><p>After his initial hut was badly damaged by the rain that he was no longer working, the mysterious man knew that if he wanted to achieve this version, he would have to do a lot of work.</p><p>And so he started from location, changing some important things. This second hut was kept in the open, so that more sunlight could reach it and dry any rain that could fall on it.</p><p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: 21.6px; font-size: 18px;"><br></p><p>After that he started working on the foundations, which this time he made sure that he was more deep in the ground than ever before.</p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
