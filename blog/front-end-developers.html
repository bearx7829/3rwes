To develop a product&nbsp;that maximize&nbsp;the user experience and meet the business needs of all our clients. Front and Developers play an important role in achieving this goal. They design and enforce it through a code so that you and the future website or application users can view and&nbsp;interact&nbsp;related information. Read more about the Front and Building stage in the Project Development Cycle.</p><p>Front end developers&nbsp;Do :</p><p>When you ask the company to make a site or app for you, many giants are used during the conversation. You will undoubtedly listen to the Front and&nbsp;Backnd&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Backnd. And when you already have a gap between the two terms, let's recover quickly. Back and developers focus on the product side that users do not see. They deal with data storing and managing data to the technologies responsible for the database communication. The structure and style of the front and product has to be made and to ensure that its visual aspect performs well. But this task is far beyond creating aesthetically pleasing interface.</p><p>Of course, the visuals on the website should be attractive and attractive. But they have to guide users via routes to complete the various tasks clearly and easily. The main purpose is to ensure that information is easy to find and read navigation. Front &amp; Developers live a variety of interface elements and convert website design into a working, interactive, user -friendly product, which means each button, animation and text piece that you finally desktop&nbsp;Look&nbsp;at</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, they will have to be skilled in developing different features and functionality (including mobile features, if needed), re -use code and enforce acceptable cross -platform and cross -device design, working in the team&nbsp;Not&nbsp;to mention the ability and detect defects. The construction of the front end is tough, and we are lucky to have the best experts in the&nbsp;Asnaff&nbsp;Tech moment.</p><p>For you, the client's IT, it is important to be the best possible front end and implement. Why?&nbsp;Because we all know how important the first impressions are for users.&nbsp;And how quickly they are fed up with an unpleasant, navigate website that does not provide answers to their problems. A suitable front &amp; user is beneficial for maintaining and product performance and in the long run, the future potential website or app saves you money on the re -development of the app.</p><p>Front end&nbsp;technology :</p><p>Earlier, the "slices" was used as a website method. This meant that specific tools were used to cut elements of the page manufactured in the&nbsp;photoshop&nbsp;and then recall them using HTML or CSS. Although we no longer use this exercise, this term is still used to describe the work of the front and developer. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are an important technology used to create interface. Depending on the purpose and complexity of the project, we take advantage of the more complex framework of the third party, such as angry or reaction.</p><p>We worked on effective ways to communicate internally and externally. Internal communication between various teams, experts, and project managers ensures smooth development processes and timely products.</p><p>Let's see an example of this: Front and experts should cooperate with designers. Various teams jointly discuss the product scheme, structure and coding language. Designers provide a website layout for the utility, format and purpose of different elements, with specific specifications. Although Front End responsible developers impose visuals, they can always use their technical knowledge to suggest some adaptation or a change in initial design, if needed. The creative team needs to finally check whether the coded product is consistent with their views. If it has been confirmed, then it can be sent for the functionality test.</p><p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: 21.6px; text-align: justify; font-size: 18px;"><br></p><p>Similarly, back and foremost experts need to communicate permanently to ensure that the website or app is expanded and supports interface performance.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Buying groceries online is not something that everyone has done yet.
