Yes, I have many days where I look in the mirror and I often guess what I do. But I really love myself. It is strange (and sad) how difficult it is to enter the loud voice (self -deprecation is too common), but I think a part of love of self -love is expressing it so that other people also express their love Easy to do.</p><p>However, "self -love" is not always&nbsp;included in the list of my personality characteristics or achievements.&nbsp;Most of my young age and adult life have been just in trying to see or work differently so I was more "worthy". It has taken me in a thorough relationship, major changes in life, and full therapy to feel like me. My physician taught me a lot about my love and where I was holding myself back. The good news is that love of self is not a destination. This is the most important relationship of a lifetime that you will ever work. Now that all of us have gone out of the way of all&nbsp;Chicy&nbsp;clutches, read for the five things I have learned from my physician who has helped me love myself and maybe you love yourself too I'll help.</p><p>Perfection is not a goal in your&nbsp;life :</p><p>When I first started to see my physician, I told him about my anxiety that he considered it "illogical" and "a little crazy" (as if he made her somehow less irrational or crazy&nbsp;Is?). I also explained the behavior of my morning meditation, such as sleeping with TV or scrubbing through&nbsp;Instagram, "I know it's bad ..." I get frustrated if I failed to do health purpose. So, I couldn't sleep.&nbsp;Night because the tension kept me awake, or made the wrong decision. I used these "failed goals" to explain what was wrong with me, rather than asking that something could be wrong in the goals (but even more below it).</p><p>The decision about my own behavior was the idea that I had to be&nbsp;perfect. But not achieving a purpose or making a mistake is not a failure. This is a way to know&nbsp;yourself&nbsp;better. Also, you already know that not every clutch self -help book and inspirational reference is possible (so start to believe it!), But even if it was a pursuit, get it, get it You will not be happy with. As a human being, your goal should be found, not to achieve perfection.</p><p>Self love&nbsp;is not&nbsp;enough :</p><p>Love of self is a skill, not a situation.&nbsp;Like happiness or thankfulness, when you reach a particular job title or paint size, you just love yourself. This is a muscle that needs to be repeatedly working to strengthen.&nbsp;Every negative thinking, moment of self -esteem, or criticism that comes out is like a process to improve itself, because you can recognize this thinking and instead&nbsp;choose more positive thinking. Also, please stop saying that once weight loses, get growth, or get more money, then you will love yourself. The brain is not a way to work. You get your custom in life because you first find out that you deserve it, not on the other way.</p><p>Problems In&nbsp;Life :</p><p>So you do not look like&nbsp;photoshop&nbsp;influenian, can't resist the cheese fries, or are too slow to work five times a week. You probably use all these "failures" as a justification for criticizing yourself, as you think,&nbsp;"If I just look more power or look more attractive, I can get my custom." But why do you want to get these things first place? Is anyone else looking like you will really make you happy?&nbsp;no. Will working five times a week make you happy?&nbsp;no. Will you be happy to say "no" to cheese fries? No heel. In fact, we are&nbsp;very&nbsp;trapped in what we have to&nbsp;do, want, and that we forget about what we will really make to us. If you are not meeting expectations, the problem is not you. The problem is that your expectations and goals are not really compatible with what makes you happy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to my own love,&nbsp;I allow my body to be in a healthy place in which he wants to be. My "ideal weight" is the one I feel the strongest, excited and healthy but also has one. Allows me to enjoy extra delight, leisure moments and enjoyment&nbsp;that&nbsp;enables&nbsp;life to live. We should have our own expectations and tools that we use to help you live a happy life. Otherwise, what's the matter?</p><p>Self&nbsp;Respect&nbsp;:</p><p>So these days, love of self -love gets all the resonance, but I want to introduce you with a new word that is even more important: self -esteem. Unfortunately, most of us are not going to live with&nbsp;Lizzon&nbsp;Wabis&nbsp;24/7 and love everything about ourselves (even not&nbsp;Lizzo!). You may want to change your nose, the way you look in a dress, or you are sorry for something.&nbsp;And it's okay, why when you love yourself (and I mean really, really loves myself), it's not like you don't have those thoughts, it's just that's just that you know That things do not make you less than what you are.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You get the love of yourself the same way you create&nbsp;another relationship: care about you, do what you say, enjoy the time alone, please, and keep thinking. Trust is the same when you trust your words, and when you really live,&nbsp;your own word is confident, and self -esteem comes. The purpose of self -confidence and self -esteem instead of knowing that love of self would be followed.</p><p><br></p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
